  "content": "<p>One famous example is \"Star Trek\", where the starship Enterprise jumps from star system to star system to visit other planets.<br/>\"If Captain Kirk were constrained to move at the speed of our fastest rockets, it would take him a hundred thousand years just to get to the next star system,\" said Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in Mountain View, Calif, in a 2010 interview with Space.com's sister site LiveScience. \"So science fiction has long postulated a way to beat the speed of light barrier so the story can move a little more quickly.\"<br/>But in reality, the concept is \"a lot of hype,\" Shostak said.<br/>The concept of hyperspace travel is also known as hyperdrive, subspace and warp speed.<br/>But the dearth of research and scholarly discussion on the transportation method make it more often a convenient literary device than scientific possibility, Shostak said.</p>",
