    "content": "<p>Ancient clusters of rock that preserve some of the oldest microbes on Earth occasionally possess mysterious branch-like formations. Now, scientists think they know what might have caused this enigmatic branching â€” changes in microbial activity in the shallow lakes and seas where life first evolved.</p><p>These findings, published in the July issue of the journal Geobiology, could help researchers decipher potential signs of primitive life on distant planets, scientists said.</p><p>\"Most of the history of life on Earth was dominated by microbial life, and if we want to anchor our understanding of microbial evolution to this history of life we need to look at what information we can pull out of the sedimentary record,\" said study lead author Tyler Mackey, a geo-biologist at the University of California, Davis.</p>",
